        <p>YOXEL, Inc., a California corporation ("<b>YOXEL</b>", "<b>us</b>", or "<b>we</b>"), provides a messaging-based email service and productivity app called Threads (the "<b>Service</b>" or "<b>Threads</b>"), designed to enable users of third party messaging platforms, i.g. Slack,  (each, "<b>Third-Party Platform</b>”) to send, receive emails, and organize conversations. This Terms of Service document (this "<b>Agreement</b>") sets forth the terms and conditions pursuant to which we will provide you, as an end user of Threads, with access to Threads. If you are an end user whose organization has invited you to use Threads as part of their team, your use of Threads is also governed by this Terms of Service document.</p>

        <li>Warranty Disclaimer. <br>
        ◦	TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED &quot;AS IS&quot; AND &quot;AS AVAILABLE&quot;, WITH ALL FAULTS AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND WE HEREBY DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES AND CONDITIONS WITH RESPECT THERETO, EITHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF MERCHANTABILITY, OF SATISFACTORY QUALITY, OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OF ACCURACY, OF QUIET ENJOYMENT, AND OF NONINFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS. WE DO NOT WARRANT AGAINST INTERFERENCE WITH YOUR ENJOYMENT OF THE SERVICE, THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN OR PERFORMED OR PROVIDED BY THE SERVICE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE SERVICE WILL BE CORRECTED. NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE THAT WE GIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY.
        ◦	Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, YOXEL makes no warranty, expressed or implied, regarding accuracy, adequacy, completeness, legality, readability, reliability or usefulness of any Content that is transmitted, formatted or translated via the Service, even where Content has been translated, reformatted, re-tagged or otherwise subjected to technical modifications pursuant to Section 7. The foregoing disclaimer applies to both isolated and aggregate processing, transmission and uses of Content. You acknowledge that electronic data in transmission may be altered during and subsequent to original distribution.</li>

        <li><b>Limitation of Liability.</b> TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT SHALL YOXEL BE LIABLE FOR (a) PERSONAL INJURY OR ANY INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, INDIRECT, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES WHATSOEVER, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF PROFITS, LOSS OF DATA, BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, OR ANY OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE SERVICE, HOWEVER CAUSED, REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY (CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE) AND EVEN IF YOXEL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES, OR (b) ANY DAMAGES WHATSOEVER ARISING OUT OF TRANSACTIONS YOU CONDUCT WITH THIRD PARTIES THROUGH THE SERVICE. IN NO EVENT SHALL YOXEL&apos;S TOTAL LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES (OTHER THAN AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW IN CASES INVOLVING PERSONAL INJURY CAUSED BY YOXEL) EXCEED THE GREATER OF (I) THE TOTAL AMOUNT THAT YOU PAID FOR THE SERVICE, IF ANY, IN THE MONTH PERIOD PRECEDING THE APPLICABLE CLAIM, OR (II) $50.00. THE FOREGOING LIMITATIONS WILL APPLY EVEN IF THE ABOVE STATED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CERTAIN TYPES OF DAMAGES, SO THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.</li>

        <li><b>Compliance with Law.</b> To the extent you choose to use the Service, you agree to comply with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws. You may not use or otherwise export or re-export it except as authorized by United States law and the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Service was accessed.</li>

        <li><b>Interactions with Others.</b> The Service facilitates communications between individuals via email across Third-Party Platforms. YOU ARE SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR YOUR INTERACTIONS WITH OTHERS AND AGREE THAT YOXEL WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF ANY INTERACTIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES ENABLED VIA THE SERVICE, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DAMAGES RELATING TO PERSONAL INJURY OR DESTRUCTION OF PROPERTY.

        <li><b>Arbitration.</b> Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of this Agreement will be settled by binding arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Rules (or Consumer Rules, to the extent applicable) of the American Arbitration Association (&quot;<b>Rules</b>&quot;) then in effect. Notwithstanding those Rules, the following provisions will apply to such arbitration: (a) the arbitration will be conducted by a single arbitrator, (b) the fees of the arbitrator(s) shall be equally borne (50/50) by the parties, and (c) the proceedings shall be in the English language and shall take place in Austin, Texas or another location reasonably convenient to both parties. The arbitrator shall reach a binding decision regarding the issues presented as it deems fair, reasonable and appropriate, and such decision shall have the full force and effect of a binding judgment, which may be entered in any court having proper jurisdiction. Each party may seek injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction. <b>You and YOXEL agree to resolve any dispute in arbitration on an individual basis only, and not on a class or collective basis. The arbitrator shall have no authority to consider or resolve any claim or issue any relief on any basis other than an individual basis</b>. If at any point this provision is determined to be unenforceable, the parties agree that this provision shall not be severable, unless it is determined that the arbitration may still proceed on an individual basis only.</li>

        <li><b>Governing Law.</b> This Agreement shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of the State of California, USA, without regard to any principles of conflict of laws.</li>

        <li><b>Assignment.</b> YOXEL may freely transfer or assign this Agreement and any of its rights or obligations hereunder. You shall not assign this Agreement, directly or indirectly without the prior written consent of YOXEL. Any such attempted assignment shall be void.</li>

        <li><b>Modifications.</b> We may modify the terms of this Agreement from time to time. Any modification shall be effective when we notify you of the modification (via an update delivered through the Service or via email or other notification) and you signify your acceptance through your continued use of the Service after such date.</li>

        <li><b>General.</b> If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable for any reason, the remaining provisions hereof shall be unaffected and remain in full force and effect. The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Failure or delay in enforcing any right or provision of this Agreement shall not be deemed a waiver of such right or provision with respect to any subsequent breach. This Agreement constitutes the complete agreement between the parties and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous discussions, representations, and proposals, whether in writing or oral, with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement.</li>
